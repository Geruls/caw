Copyright (C) 2021 Broski Clan Development

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed
with the exception of translating this License.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISRIBUTING AND MODIFYING:

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed 
by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Broski General License. 
The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, 
and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: 
that is to say, a work translated into another language. 
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
The term "source code" refers to a state of the Program ideal for modification, and
the term "object code" refers to a (compiled) state of the Program ideal for execution.

Activities other than copying, distributing or modifying are outside the scope of this License, so the copyright holder of the Program cannot take action against third parties who do activities
other than the above.

Running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). 
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

1. Source code.

Distribution of this Program's source code as you receive it (in any medium) is permitted, provided
that you publish on each copy of the Program an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty,
and that all the notices referring to this License and the absence of any warranty is kept intact.
When distributing, make sure that this License comes with the Program - unless the Program
is a library, which will then also be covered by Section 6 of this License.

You are permitted to charge a fee for physically transferring a copy, and if wanted, offer warranty protection
in exchange for a(nother) fee.

2. Modification of the Program.

Modification of this Program or any portion of it forms a work based on the Program, so you may copy
and distribute such modifications (or work) under Section 1 above, provided that:

    a) The modified files must carry prominent notices stating that you changed the file(s) and the date
    of the change(s).

    b) If the modified program (work) normally reads commands when run, it is mandatory to
    cause it to print or display an announcement, which includes an appropriate copyright notice and
    a notice that there is no warranty (unless you provide warranty), and that users may
    redistribute the Program under this License, and also tell the user how to view a copy
    of this License.

3. Output of the Program.

The output from the Program is not covered unless its contents constitute a work based on the Program.

4. Activities not covered by this License.

Activities other than copying, distributing or modifying this program is not covered by
the terms of this License, and thus are not restricted. An example of an other activity is running the Program.

5. Object code.

Other than distributing source code, which Section 1 covers, distributing object code is permitted provided
that the object code distributed under the terms of Section 1.

6. Dual-licensing.

THIS APPLIES ONLY IN THE CASE THAT THE PROGRAM IS A LIBRARY.
A "Combined Work" means another Program made containing the Program covered by this License.
The Combined Work must distribute this License with it, however dual-licensing, meaning that the work is covered
by more than one License, is permitted - provided that the other License does not forbid dual-licensing.

7. Acceptance of this License.

If you do not accept this License, you are still allowed to get or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation 
of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy 
likewise does not require acceptance. However, you have to accept this License in order to modify or distribute the
Program.

8. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions 
of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered 
work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to 
collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could 
satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

9. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

11. Patents.

A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.
A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.
In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.
A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

12. Disclaimer of Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, 
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. 
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE 
COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE 
THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, 
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED 
TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS 
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY 
AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM 
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

13. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL 
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS 
PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, 
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE 
PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR 
LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY 
OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
